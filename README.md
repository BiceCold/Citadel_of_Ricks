# Citadel_of_Ricks
The citadel is a place for Ricks to hang out and wait to be summoned. Each Rick will be callable in a discord bot.

In order for Anti-Politics Rick to work properly you must include a .env file in your project containing keys for imgur and discord. the format is:

client_id = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'
client_secret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
refresh_token = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
access_token = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
discord_token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
