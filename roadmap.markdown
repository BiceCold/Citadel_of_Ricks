Anti-Politics Rick
==================

1.  Complete error handling in the module. Specifically, handle timeout or
    crashes by logging a message somewhere and then restarting the service.

2.  Increase the quotes list and move it to another file to make the primary
    module cleaner.

3.  Break them out gifs into a self-contained class.

4.  Refactor the module so that anti-politics Rick can be called as a class.

Gif Rick
========

1.  Add more gifs.

2.  Create a class of Gif Rick that can be called by the citadel
